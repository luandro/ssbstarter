# SSB Starter

Make sure you're running NodeJS > v10.

Open the `./android` directory on Android Studio to download necessary files.

Run `npm run build` to build the NodeJS project, located at `nodejs-assets/nodejs-project/`.

Finally run `react-native run-android` to start the app. Use `react-native log-android` to log, and `npm run clean-android` to clear cache.
